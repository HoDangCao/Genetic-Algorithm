# GeneticðŸ§¬Algorithm (GA)

### What is a Genetic Algorithm?
A **genetic algorithm** is a search technique that **mimics natural selection** to find optimal solutions by iteratively refining a population of candidate solutions.

### Why use Genetic Algorithms?
- be beneficial in optimization issues when traditional methods fail.
- efficiently navigate large and complex search spaces, making them ideal for tasks that require finding optimal solutions under restrictions.

### Algorithm of GA
- Initialization
- Fitness Function
- Selection
- Crossover (or Recombination)
- Mutation
- Termination
